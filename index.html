				<p id="intro">Hello! I'm Ryan Scarpelli.</p>
				<p>I am 20 years old, a student at UAlbany, and I fancy myself a Web Developer.<p>
				<p>Currently, I am pursuing my B.S. in Informatics, with a focus in Cyber Security.</p>
				<p>Web Development is my passion because I love creating work which people can use and enjoy.</p>
				<p>I created this website entirely from scratch, and it is a constant work in progress.</p>
				<p>This website is proudly hosted by GitHub, and my source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/ryanscarpelli/ryanscarpelli.github.io">here</a>.</p>

			<p class="bbbig">"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. <br />
				The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, <br />
				because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; <br />
				who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, <br />
				so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."<br /> - Theodore Roosevelt</p>
