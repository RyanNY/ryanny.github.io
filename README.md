1.) Version Conventions

The version will consist of two integers in the form of "0.0" (no quotes).

1a.) Primary Integer The primary integer designates the RELEASE, and will be incremented only when a stable, public-ready release is created and tested. Example: 1.0 is "Release 1".

2b.) Secondary Integer The secondary integer designates the REVISION, and will be incremented whenever a meaningful change is made to the code. Example: 1.1 is "Release 1, Revision 1".
